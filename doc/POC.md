# Create demo codespace

Creating a demo Codespace on GitHub is a great way to showcase your project's development environment and enable collaborators to quickly spin up a development environment without needing to set up anything locally. Here's a step-by-step guide to create a demo Codespace on GitHub:


# Set Up Kubernetes Cluster

We will use k3d to create a demo Kubernetes cluster.
k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.


# Install ArgoCD

We will use official ArgoCD documentation to install ArgoCD on the Kubernetes cluster.

## Access ArgoCD CLI/UI


## Demonstrate Basic Functionality


# Conclusions
